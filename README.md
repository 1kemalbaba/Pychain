# PychainDescription: 
I built PyChain, a lightweight blockchain in Python using ECDSA signatures for security, a P2P simulation, and a CLI for interaction. Itâ€™s a basic, educational tool to explore blockchain concepts.

-Requirements: pip install ecdsa

-Usage: Instructions for running and interacting via the CLI.

-License: e.g., MIT License.

-File: Save as pychain.py.

i would like to create my own blockchain in future.
